### Short answer to the following questions:

- I have chosen MongoDB as the database and Mongoose as the ORM. MongoDB offers schema flexibility, horizontal scalability, high performance, and seamless integration with Node.js. Mongoose provides a powerful schema-based solution, enhancing data modeling and validation, simplifying database interactions.
- From this assignment, I learned how to effectively structure a Node.js application with MongoDB and Mongoose, how to implement and document RESTful APIs, and the importance of environment configuration for secure and scalable application deployment.
- The most difficult part of the assignment was ensuring seamless integration of Mongoose schemas and implementing complex relationships between categories, subcategories, and items while maintaining efficient data retrieval and validation.
- Given more time, I would implement comprehensive testing using tools like Jest and Supertest, enhance error handling and validation, optimize database queries for better performance, and improve documentation to include detailed API usage examples and edge cases.
